Despite our arguments, we completed the task on time and had an excellent group presentation. From this experience, I learned that it is very hard to be a good team member.

First, you know what, many young people like me are very busy with work, study and other activities, which makes finding time to cook meals so hard. Second, it is so convenient to order delicious dishes on some apps like Shopee Food, Beamin and so on.

Đầu tiên, bạn biết không, nhiều người trẻ như tôi rất bận rộn với công việc, học tập và các hoạt động khác nên việc tìm thời gian để nấu bữa ăn trở nên khó khăn. Thứ hai, thật tiện lợi khi đặt những món ăn ngon trên một số ứng dụng như Shopee Food, Beamin, v.v. Cuối cùng, giới trẻ thích được phục vụ đồ ăn tại nhà hàng.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",

Owning certain domesticated animals can bring wonderful benefits to both the pet and the people living in the home. Pets can offer companionship, combating loneliness and providing a sense of belonging. Studies even suggest they can improve our physical and mental health by lowering stress and encouraging exercise. Caring for a pet fosters responsibility and empathy, especially valuable for children, while also creating a routine that brings a sense of purpose. Most importantly, these advantages apply to animals well-suited for domestic life. For wild animals, a home environment can be far from ideal, so it's vital to always research an animal's specific needs before welcoming them into your life.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
