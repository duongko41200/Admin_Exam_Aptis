On the one hand, people desire a lot of material possessions. For instance, some yearn for new clothes, so they go shopping; some want to eat scrumptious dishes, so they work hard to afford it.

But I specifically remember a time when I asked my professor about a topic that we had to do a presentation about but I didn’t have much knowledge about it. So I did ask him a number of questions related to the topic and I was so pleased that he was extremely enthusiastic about explaining all the notions to me and even gave me some reference documents to read.

The fact that some subjects are difficult to comprehend may depend on a variety of reasons. It may be because of different academic capacities or one’s interest and enthusiasm in the subject. For example, some may find maths difficult to understand but have a knack for music and arts, and vice versa. And people can not change the nature of such subjects, but we have to do research to acquire better knowledge about that subject, or simply pursue what they are more interested in or better at.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp class=\"ql-align-justify\"\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",

There was one subject called crafts, I think. And, the teacher told us to make our own wooden house. It was my very first time doing it so I was quite unsure and not ready. After hearing instructions from my teacher and with the help of my classmates, I started to do it. And it turned out that making a wooden house is not that difficult. I finally managed to finish my own house. My friends and I continuously talked and laughed during the process. In the end, my teacher awarded a prize to three students who had the most beautiful houses and luckily I was one of them.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"background-color: transparent;\"\u003EHow did you feel when you finished it?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"\u003EI think it was a sense of accomplishment and I also felt proud of myself because I always thought that I was bad at doing something like DIY stuff. But that experience totally changed my mind, I had the ability to make a wooden house. It was incredible. After the class, I ran home and showed my parents what I had made and they gave compliments to me. My “piece of work” is now being displayed in the living room of my childhood home and I think I will keep it forever.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"background-color: transparent;\"\u003EPeople should make as many items as they can instead of buying them.

I believe each person should focus on specializing their strengths. For example, those who are good at producing clothes should produce clothes and those who are good at growing vegetables should grow vegetables. That way, everyone can create income for themselves and value for society. We will sell what we produce well and buy what we cannot make ourselves. This is how the economy is and will continue to develop.&nbsp;\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
